        the good ol'' Potato and Tomato Stew! A humble dish that''ll warm your bones
        after a long day''s journey.\n\nListen close now while I tell ye how to prepare
        this satisfying meal:\n\n1. Dice those potatoes into nice chunky bits - we''re
        not running a fancy noble''s kitchen here\n2. Cut them tomatoes about the
        same size as the potatoes\n3. Get yourself a sturdy pot with some oil in the
        bottom\n4. Start with them potatoes first - they take longer to soften, give
        ''em about 10 minutes\n5. Toss in the tomatoes and let them break down into
        a nice sauce\n6. Add a pinch of salt and whatever herbs you''ve got growing
        in your garden\n7. Let it all simmer together till the potatoes are tender
        and the tomatoes have made themselves into a proper sauce\n\nTruth be told,
        it''s not the fanciest dish you''ll ever eat, but it''s honest food that''ll
        fill your belly and keep you going. Some folk like to add a bit of garlic
        or onion, and I won''t stop ''em - makes it even better if you ask me. Now,
        shall I fetch you a bowl?"}],"stop_reason":"end_turn","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":117,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":269}}'
